Update meson script. currently it won't work for a clean build which could be required in debuild.

Add build script:

    update release-version.txt
    add debian changelog log entry
    run debuild to build the package
    run `dpkg -i` to install the deb package just built.
    run `dput -f bodz` to upload the deb package just built.
