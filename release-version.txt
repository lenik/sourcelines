======= ABOUT ========

This file contains the current version information and release timestamp, presented in the following format:

- **Line 1**: Major.Minor.Release-Patch
- **Line 2**: Datetime (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS)

For the auto-build system, version control is critical to maintaining consistency and tracking updates across different stages of development. The following versioning rules apply:

- **Release number adjustments**:  
  Each time a new package is released, either the **release number** or the **patch number** should be incremented based on the nature of the changes:
    - **New or removed source files**: If new source files are added or existing ones are removed, the **release number** should be increased, and the **patch number** should be reset to 0. This reflects a more substantial change in the codebase.
    - **Modifications to existing files**: If only existing files are modified (e.g., bug fixes, optimizations, or minor changes), the **patch number** should be incremented by 1. This helps track incremental improvements and fixes without affecting the broader release version.

- **Patch number reset**:  
  When the **release version number** is incremented (due to the addition or removal of files), the **patch number** is automatically reset to 0. This ensures that the patch number always reflects changes relative to the current release version.

Additionally, the **ABOUT** section is an integral part of the copilot system’s operation. It contains essential information necessary for the system’s correct functioning and should **never be altered, removed, or modified**. The integrity of this section is crucial to ensure that the version history and system operations remain intact.
